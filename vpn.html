    <h2> Virtual Private Networks (VPN)</h2>
    <p> Virtial Private Networks work to mask your actual location by masking your IP address (Information Protocol). <br> 
        Your broadband router uses an IP address and any technology in your house also uses IP addresses to connect to the internet, <br> 
        when someone finds your IP address they can then gain access to more information about where you live and a VPN masks that so that <br> 
        someone cannot find where you live (or makes it more difficult to do).</p>
